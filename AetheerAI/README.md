An autonomous, multi-agent AI Operating System written in Python 3.10+.  
It manages AI agents the way an OS manages processes — with scheduling, security, memory, tools, and self-improvement built in.

> **Most AI today is Reactive** — it waits for you.  
> **AetheerAI is Proactive** — it builds systems that work *for* you.  
> It is the difference between a tool you hold in your hand and an engine that runs in the background.

## Purpose (Clear and Practical)

AetheerAI is built to run autonomous business and engineering workflows from one goal.

Primary output:
- You provide one goal (example: build a feature, run weekly analytics, generate a market brief).
- AetheerAI plans tasks, assigns specialist agents, executes with guardrails, and returns deliverables.

Primary use-cases:
- Product delivery automation: plan and generate feature code, docs, and deployment artifacts.
- Repeated operations: scheduled multi-step pipelines for research, reporting, and notifications.
- Governed AI execution: approval gates, permission levels, and audit logs for risky actions.

## Quick Start

Run one command:

python main.py

This starts the FastAPI server at http://localhost:8000 and docs at http://localhost:8000/docs.

Frontend UI is available at:
- http://localhost:8000/

Core API endpoints exposed immediately:
- POST /predict
- GET /status

Quick API checks:

curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/status

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"hello"}'

## What is AetheerAI?

### 1. The "Project Manager" — *for Business Owners*

Imagine you are the CEO of a company. You don't have time to write every email, code every feature, or talk to every customer.

- **The Master (AetheerAI):** This is your **Project Manager**. You tell it the goal (e.g., *"Launch a new product"*).
- **The Sub-Agents:** The Project Manager "hires" a Designer, a Coder, and a Marketer.
- **The Result:** AetheerAI doesn't just "chat" — it **builds the team**, gives them instructions, and makes sure they work together until the job is done.

---

### 2. The "Digital Assembly Line" — *for Engineers*

In the old world (2024), AI was a single craftsman making one thing at a time. In 2026, AetheerAI is the **Factory Owner**.

It builds a **Digital Assembly Line** where:
- one agent grabs raw data,
- another agent cleans it,
- a third agent analyzes it,
- and a fourth agent sends it to your Slack or Gmail.

If one "machine" (agent) breaks, the Master AI **fixes it or replaces it instantly** without stopping the whole line.

---

### 3. The "Smart City" Traffic System — *for Non-Techies*

Think of all your apps (Slack, GitHub, Salesforce, Notion) as **buildings in a city**. AetheerAI is the **Traffic Control Center**.

- It creates **Autonomous Vehicles** (Agents) that know how to navigate between these buildings.
- One agent goes to the "GitHub Building" to get code, drives it to the "Slack Building" to notify the team, and then parks the results in the "Google Drive Building."
- AetheerAI ensures there are **no crashes** and that every agent is on the most efficient route.

---

### 4. The "Orchestra" vs. the "Soloist" — *for Investors*

A standard AI is a **solo pianist** — it can play a great song, but it's just one person.

**AetheerAI is the Conductor.**

- The Conductor doesn't play an instrument; it **leads a Symphony of Agents**.
- The "Strings" (Research Agents), the "Brass" (Execution Agents), and the "Percussion" (Security Agents) all play together in perfect sync to create a complex masterpiece.

| Audience | Best Metaphor |
|---|---|
| Business Owners | The "Project Manager" — focus on delegation |
| Engineers | The "Digital Assembly Line" — focus on workflow |
| Non-Techies | The "Smart City" — focus on movement and apps |
| Investors | The "Orchestra" — focus on the beauty of coordination |

---

## Use Cases — What Problem Does It Solve?

### The core problem

Every AI tool available today — ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini — is a **single-turn assistant**.  
You ask one question, it answers, and then it **forgets everything** and waits for you to ask again.

This means **you** are still the project manager. You still have to:
- break the goal into steps,
- copy output from one tool to another,
- notice when something fails and retry it,
- keep track of what has and hasn't been done.

**AetheerAI removes you from that loop entirely.**  
You give it a goal. It plans, assigns, executes, monitors, and delivers — by itself.

---

### Real-world problems it solves

#### Problem 1 — "I need a full feature, not a code snippet"

> *"Write me a user authentication system with JWT, a login endpoint, password hashing, and a Dockerfile."*

| Without AetheerAI | With AetheerAI |
|---|---|
| Prompt ChatGPT for the route → copy → prompt for JWT → copy → prompt for Docker → copy → fix conflicts manually | One `orchestrate` command. CEO agent plans 4 tasks, assigns them to DeveloperAgent, monitors, and saves all files to `workspace/`. |

---

#### Problem 2 — "Research takes hours before I can even start building"

> *"Before building, I need to know the best practices, the competitor landscape, and what tech stack to use."*

| Without AetheerAI | With AetheerAI |
|---|---|
| Open 10 browser tabs, read docs, take notes, summarise manually | ResearchAgent runs web searches in parallel, fact-checks sources, and delivers a structured report — while DeveloperAgent is already starting the scaffold in the background. |

---

#### Problem 3 — "I run the same multi-step workflow every week"

> *"Every Monday: pull last week's sales CSV, clean it, analyse trends, write a summary, email it to the team."*

| Without AetheerAI | With AetheerAI |
|---|---|
| Open spreadsheet, run scripts, write summary, manually send email — 2 hours every week | Define the pipeline once. `run_pipeline dataTeam "run weekly sales report"` — runs in under 2 minutes, unattended. |

---

#### Problem 4 — "I'm a solo founder — I can't afford five specialists"

> *"I need a researcher, a developer, a marketer, an ops engineer, and a support agent — but I'm one person."*

| Without AetheerAI | With AetheerAI |
|---|---|
| Juggle every role yourself, context-switch constantly, burn out | Spin up a full team of specialist agents in seconds. Delegate like a CEO. Each agent has the right tools and the right permissions. |

---

#### Problem 5 — "AI ideas that break in production due to zero safety controls"

> *"I gave an AI access to my file system and it deleted the wrong folder."*

| Without AetheerAI | With AetheerAI |
|---|---|
| No guardrails — model can call any tool, write anywhere, run any command | Every destructive tool (`file_writer`, `code_runner`, `terminal`) requires explicit human approval via `ApprovalGate`. RBAC enforces per-agent permission levels. Full audit trail in `memory/audit_log.jsonl`. |

---

### Who is it for?

| Persona | Pain point solved |
|---|---|
| **Solo founders / indie hackers** | Replace a whole team with a managed agent crew |
| **Software engineers** | Automate repetitive multi-step workflows (CI tasks, code review, doc generation) |
| **Data analysts** | Build pipelines that fetch, clean, analyse, and report — unattended |
| **Marketing teams** | Research → write → publish content pipelines |
| **DevOps / SRE teams** | Self-healing automation that detects failure and retries or re-routes |
| **Researchers** | Multi-source web research, fact-checking, and structured report generation |
| **Enterprises** | Governed, audited, budget-capped AI execution with RBAC and approval gates |

---

### What it is NOT

- **Not a chatbot** — it does not wait for you to type the next message.
- **Not a single-model wrapper** — it orchestrates *multiple* agents with *different* roles, tools, and permissions.
- **Not a no-code toy** — it is a Python framework with a full REST API, security layer, and plugin tool system.
- **Not vendor-locked** — swap between OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, or GitHub Models with one config change.

### Build & export
```
build_application my-app               # AI-powered app scaffold
export_agent ResearchBot               # standalone runnable folder
export_system MyAI agent1,agent2       # multi-agent bundle w/ Docker + launchers
```

## Security

- **RBAC levels 0–3** — each agent has a `permission_level`; tools require a minimum level  
- **ApprovalGate** — destructive tools (`file_writer`, `email_tool`) and high-risk tools (`code_runner`, `terminal_tool`, AWS/GCP/K8s) require explicit operator approval  
- **Audit log** — every guarded tool call is written to `memory/audit_log.jsonl` (append-only)  
- **Memory isolation** — agents operate in private namespaces; cannot read each other's memory  
- **Path traversal hardened** — agent names sanitised; all export paths confined to base directory  
- **Docker sandbox** — `code_runner` executes code in an isolated container (network-none, ro-fs, memory capped). Execution is blocked if Docker is unavailable.

## Self-Improvement Loop

1. `EvalRunner` runs benchmark cases against an agent with a configurable timeout  
2. `FailureClustering` groups failures by error type  
3. `SelfImproveCoordinator` proposes patches, optionally gated by a quality threshold

## Project Layout

```
AI-OP/
├── app/                 Runtime entry wrappers (CLI, dashboard, server)
├── src/                 Canonical package namespace (src-layout)
├── models/              Data pipelines, configs, and trained artifacts
├── api/                 Top-level API entry point (`api.server:app`)
├── ui/                  Top-level static UI assets (`ui/index.html`)
├── main.py              Unified root entry point
└── AetheerAI/           Legacy implementation modules (kept for compatibility)
```

The runtime remains backward-compatible: the `AetheerAI/` implementation stays
intact while clean top-level architecture is exposed at repository root.

### Adding a new specialist agent

```python
# agents/my_agent.py
from agents.base_agent import BaseAgent

class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, name, tool_manager, ai_adapter):
        super().__init__(
            name=name,
            role="My Specialist",
            tools=["web_search", "file_writer"],
            permission_level=1,
            tool_manager=tool_manager,
            ai_adapter=ai_adapter,
        )
```

### Adding a new tool

```python
# tools/my_tool.py
from tools.tool_manager import register_tool

@register_tool(name="my_tool", risk="LOW", min_permission=1)
def my_tool(input_text: str) -> str:
    """One-line description of what the tool does."""
    return f"Processed: {input_text}"
```
