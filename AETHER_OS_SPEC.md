# AetherAi-A Master AI

## Objective

Build an AI Operating System named **AetherAi-A Master AI** that acts as a central AI controller capable of creating, managing, improving, and running multiple AI agents.

The system should be modular, extensible, and compatible with VS Code development workflows.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Normal AI Assistant

Aether should function like a normal AI assistant.

**Features:**
- Answer questions
- Generate code
- Assist with tasks
- Chat interface
- File analysis
- Project analysis

---

### 2. Agent Creation System

Aether must be able to create new AI agents automatically.

**The system should include:**

**AgentFactory:**
- Generate new agents
- Assign roles
- Create prompts
- Assign tools
- Register agent in registry

**Example agents:**
- Research agent
- Coding agent
- Marketing agent
- Automation agent
- Data analysis agent

Agents should be created dynamically.

---

### 3. Agent Skill Upgrade System

Agents must be able to improve over time.

**Include:**

**SkillEngine:**
- Store agent skills
- Upgrade prompts
- Add new tools
- Track performance

**Each agent should maintain:**

`agent_profile`:
- Role
- Tools
- Skills
- Performance metrics
- Version history

---

### 4. Universal Agent Builder

The system must be capable of creating any type of AI agent.

**Agent types include:**
- Coding agents
- Research agents
- Marketing agents
- Business agents
- Automation agents
- Chatbot agents
- API agents

Agents should be configurable using **JSON** or **YAML**.

---

### 5. Autonomous AI Agent Mode

Aether must also function as an autonomous agent.

**Capabilities:**
- Break tasks into subtasks
- Assign tasks to agents
- Manage workflows
- Execute tasks

**Architecture:**
```
User → Aether → Agents → Tools → Result
```

---

### 6. AI Integration Layer

The system must support multiple AI providers.

**Supported providers:**
- OpenAI
- Claude
- Gemini
- Local LLM
- Ollama
- HuggingFace models

Create an **AIAdapter** layer to switch between models.

## System Architecture

### Main Components:

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `AetherKernel` | Central controller and orchestrator |
| `AgentFactory` | Creates and configures new agents |
| `AgentRegistry` | Stores and tracks all registered agents |
| `SkillEngine` | Manages and upgrades agent skills |
| `WorkflowEngine` | Manages task workflows and pipelines |
| `ToolManager` | Registers and provides tools to agents |
| `AIAdapter` | Abstraction layer for multiple AI providers |
| `MemoryManager` | Persistent and session memory for agents |
| `TaskExecutor` | Executes tasks assigned to agents |

## Key Features

Aether should be able to:

- Create agents
- Manage agents
- Upgrade agents
- Execute workflows
- Generate applications
- Integrate external APIs

---

## Example Commands

```bash
create_agent research_agent
upgrade_agent research_agent
run_agent research_agent
create_agent marketing_agent
